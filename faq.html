				<h2>Inquiries about gravitational waves</h2>
				<p><strong>So, let's start here: can you help me wrap my head around what the heck a "gravitational wave" is?</strong><br>
					I can try! There are all sorts of analogies one could make, but the essential idea is that space and time make up a malleable geometry (cleverly called "spacetime") that can be curved in the same way as a rubber sheet or a trampoline. The way you curve spacetime is by putting something heavy on it. Anything with mass will do the trick, but only the heaviest things &mdash; stars, planets &mdash; will curve it in a way you can notice. We have a name for this curvature, by the way. We call it "gravity."</p>
				<p><strong>Don't get cute with me. How is this related to a gravitational wave?</strong><br>
					Right! A gravitational wave is what happens when you wiggle spacetime. Anytime an object moves in a way that isn't spherically or cyllindrically symmetric, it will make ripples in spacetime the same way that a rock does when you skip it across a pond. But since gravitation is such a weak interaction (remember that Newton's constant is, like, 0.00000000006 in SI units), any gravitational wave effect is going to have a very, very small amplitude.</p>
				<p><strong>How small are we talking?</strong><br>
					Well, if you look at some of the most energetic explosions in the universe, such as an exploding supernova or coalescing compact objects, the relative change in length due to gravitational waves passing you by on Earth is only about 1 part in 10<sup>23</sup>. (This is if you view the explosion from a distance of 300 million light-years. They happen so rarely in any given galaxy that any time we see one, they'll be at least that far away.)</p>
				<p><strong>Woah. I know that's a stupidly tiny number, but do you have an analogy that might put it into stark context?</strong><br>
					It's like comparing the width of a human hair (about a millionth of a meter) to the distance to the nearest star (4 light-years, or 10,000,000,000,000,000 meters).</p>
				<p><strong>Get out! You get right out!!</strong><br>
					I know! Like you put so well, these numbers boggle the imagination.</p>
				<h2>Inquiries about LIGO</h2>
				<p><strong>LIGO is this engineering marvel that has made us sensitive to gravitational waves on that order of magnitude. What is the significance of this for science?</strong><br>
					The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (or LIGO, if like me you're not a fan of syllables) is a set of two detectors, one in Hanford, WA and the other in Livingston, LA, both in the U.S. (There are a couple of European counterparts, Virgo and GEO, and another called KAGRA in Japan, with plans to build a third LIGO detector in India.) These LIGO detectors are a pair of L-shaped arms, each 4 km (or 2.5 miles) in length. We use LASERS!!! to measure relative length changes in these arms on the order of 1 part in 10<sup>23</sup>, in a frequency range that spans from about 20 Hz to 8,000 Hz. The instruments are so sensitive that seismic ground motion from cars, trains, earthquakes, even particularly strong wind gusts can knock us out of alignment. Fortunately we have a battalion of scientists on constant vigilance monitoring the quality of data streaming out of the LIGO sites. (You can even learn more about this at <a href="http://pem.ligo.org">pem.ligo.org</a>.) More to the point, though, we now have a new way of studying the universe. It's not hyperbole to say that when LIGO made its first discovery, we opened up a new sense onto the cosmos.</p>
				<p><strong>What? What do you mean, a new sense?</strong><br>
					Ever since Norwegian opticians first observed with optical telescopes more than 400 years ago, all the information we've ever gleaned about the universe has come from light. Radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and &gamma;-ray astronomy are all to do with the electromagnetic spectrum, and while different information is learned by looking in different frequency ranges on this spectrum, it's still only one avenue of information &mdash; only one sense. In the 1980s came neutrino astronomy, where we began to learn more about supernovae, for example. But by "listening" to gravitational waves, we are witnessing events that we simply could not through any other means.</p>
				<p><strong>The first gravitational wave discovery was of a pair of black holes, is that what you mean?</strong><br>
					Yes! Exactly. The gravitational wave transient sources GW150914 and GW151226, so named for the UTC calendar dates on which they occurred, each involved the inspiral and merger of two stellar-mass black holes. The defining feature of a black hole is an absence of light. Unless there's any matter in the immediate vicinity for it to consume, black holes don't radiate light. So, gravitational waves are truly the only way we could have recorded events like these.</p>
				<h2>Inquiries about societal impact</h2>
				<p><strong>In broad terms, can you give some flavor what these observations imply that we didn't know before?</strong><br>
					Awesome question! The technical achievement of discovering gravitational waves is quite nice, but what's the actual scientific value added? By measuring the masses of these black holes, we know that GW150914 must have occurred in an environment that is low in metals, and that would require a special class of galaxy. By measuring their spins, we can tell whether the binary system formed through what's called dynamical capture (say, a couple of objects in a dense stellar environment pass close enough to become gravitationally bound) or through "common envelope evolution" (where the binary existed for a long time, and both stars shared a common hydrogen envelope before going supernova). If we could observe the host galaxies of these events with classical telescopes, we could learn even more information.</p>
				<p><strong>What's the societal impact of projects like LIGO? Why should Thelma T. Taxpayer care about funding your science experiment?</strong><br>
					I personally love this question, because it shows how engaged people are. I have this device in my pocket that I can use to instantly connect with any other human being on planet Earth almost instantaneously. It's almost a complete black box to me, but I know that I have this device because a hundred years ago a gang of mostly German scientists pursued some hare-brained idea they called Quantum Mechanics. You can say the same thing about any aspect of technology: the Space Race in the 1960s lead to a tech boom the likes of which had never really been seen in society up to that point, for example. Funding, building, and running projects like LIGO are paramount to the status of the United States as a leader in world technology. Not to mention, I can't thing of a single human endeavor that brings together quite so many people from so many disparate backgrounds. Diversity is not "merely" the right thing to do; it's a crucial factor in innovative problem solving. I've always believed in that.</p>
				<h2>Personal Inquiries</h2>
				<p><strong>Do you remember where you were when you first heard the news?</strong><br>
					I'll <strong>never</strong> forget where I was when I first heard the news. For the first event, GW150914, I was actually staying on-site at the detector in Livingston. I was asleep, because it happened around 4:50 in the morning local time. When I woke up, I did what I always do: check email. I was quite groggy though and it didn't occur to me the full gravity of the situation (no pun intended) until I got into the site for my 8 AM control room shift. The mood was jubilant, almost otherworldy. There were people who had been waiting for this moment their entire professional careers.<br>
					For the second event, GW151226, it was still Christmas Day in the U.S. and that's my birthday. I was watching some movie with my roommates in Milwaukee when I got the call around 10 PM. I jumped up and shouted excited obscenities, then dashed off to do science. My roommates weren't allowed to know why because of the secrecy of the project. I'll admit, that felt pretty cool. One of them asked if I was ever allowed to just shut off. "No," I said, "science does not wait for you to be ready."</p>
				<p><strong>Lastly, is Alex Urban your real name?</strong><br>
					Yep! Indeed, it has been for nearly three decades. My mom has excellent taste.</p>
