				<p><strong>So, let's start here: can you help me wrap my head around what the heck a "gravitational wave" is?</strong><br>
					I can try! There are all sorts of analogies one could make, but the essential idea is that space and time make up a malleable geometry (cleverly called "spacetime") that can be curved in the same way as a rubber sheet or a trampoline. The way you curve spacetime is by putting something heavy on it. Anything with mass will do the trick, but only the heaviest things &mdash; stars, planets &mdash; will curve it in a way you can notice. We have a name for this curvature, by the way. We call it "gravity."</p>
				<p><strong>Don't get cute with me. How is this related to a gravitational wave?</strong><br>
					Now, a gravitational wave is what happens when you wiggle spacetime. Anytime an object moves in a way that isn't spherically or cyllindrically symmetric, it will make ripples in spacetime the same way that a rock does when you skip it across a pond. But since gravitation is such a weak interaction (remember that Newton's constant is, like, 0.00000000006 in SI units), any gravitational wave effect is going to have a very, very small amplitude.</p>
				<p><strong>How small are we talking?</strong><br>
					Well, if you look at some of the most energetic explosions in the universe, such as an exploding supernova or coalescing compact objects, the relative change in length due to gravitational waves passing you by on Earth is about 1 part in 10<sup>23</sup>. (This is if you view the explosion from a distance of 300 million light-years.)</p>
				<p><strong>Woah. I know that's a stupidly tiny number, but do you have an analogy that might put it into stark context?</strong><br>
					It's like comparing the width of a human hair (about a millionth of a meter) to the distance to the nearest star (4 light-years, or 10,000,000,000,000,000 meters).</p>
				<p><strong>Get out! You get right out!!</strong><br>
					I know! Like you put so well, these numbers boggle the imagination.</p>
				<p><strong>LIGO is this engineering marvel that has made us sensitive to gravitational waves on that order of magnitude. What is the significance of this for science?</strong><br>
					The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (or LIGO, if like me you're not a fan of syllables) is a set of two detectors, one in Hanford, WA and the other in Livingston, LA, both in the U.S. (There are a couple of European counterparts, Virgo and GEO, and another called KAGRA in Japan, with plans to build a third LIGO detector in India.) These LIGO detectors are a pair of L-shaped arms, each 4 km (or 2.5 miles) in length. We use LASERS!!! to measure relative length changes in these arms on the order of 1 part in 10<sup>23</sup>, in a frequency range that spans from about 20 Hz to 8,000 Hz. The instruments are so sensitive that seismic ground motion from cars, trains, earthquakes, even particularly strong wind gusts can knock us out of alignment. Fortunately we have a battalion of scientists on constant vigilance monitoring the quality of data streaming out of the LIGO sites. (You can even learn more about this at <a href="http://pem.ligo.org">pem.ligo.org</a>.) More to the point, though, we now have a new way of studying the universe. It's not hyperbole to say that when LIGO made its first discovery, we opened up a new sense onto the cosmos.</p>
				<p><strong>Lastly, is Alex Urban your real name?</strong><br>
					Yep! Indeed, it has been for nearly three decades. My mom has excellent taste.</p>
